2. **Good Data**: Use realistic sample data, not lorem ipsum
3. **Multiple Views**: Show different pages/features
4. **Mobile Screenshots**: Include mobile responsive views

### Step 5: File Organization

```

│   ├── project-board.png
│   └── team-collaboration.png
└── [other projects...]
```

### Step 6: Update Portfolio Data

#### In `src/components/Projects.tsx`:

1. Replace placeholder descriptions with your actual project descriptions
2. Update technology lists with the exact technologies you used
3. Add your real GitHub and demo URLs
4. Update image paths to match your uploaded images

#### Example Update:

```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  title: "Your Actual Project Name",
  description: "Your detailed project description...",
  images: [
    "/images/projects/your-project/homepage.png",
    "/images/projects/your-project/features.png",
    "/images/projects/your-project/admin.png"
  ],
  technologies: ["Laravel", "PHP", "MySQL", "Bootstrap"],
  githubUrl: "https://github.com/yourusername/your-project",
  liveUrl: "https://your-project-demo.com"
}
```

### Step 7: PDF Content Extraction

#### If PDF is Text-Based:

1. Copy text from PDF
2. Paste into a text editor
3. Organize by project sections
4. Extract key information

#### If PDF Contains Images:

1. Take screenshots of relevant sections
2. Save as separate image files
3. Use these as reference for your portfolio images

### Step 8: Quality Checklist

#### Before Finalizing:

- [ ] All project descriptions are accurate and detailed
- [ ] Technology lists match what you actually used
- [ ] All images are high quality and relevant
- [ ] GitHub URLs are correct and repositories are public
- [ ] Demo URLs work and show the actual projects
- [ ] Mobile responsive views are included
- [ ] Images show real functionality, not placeholder content

### Step 9: Testing Your Portfolio

#### After Updates:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Check all project images load correctly
3. Verify all links work
4. Test on mobile devices
5. Ensure carousel functionality works
6. Check that all sections are properly linked

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```
